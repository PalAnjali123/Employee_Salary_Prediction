# Employee_Salary_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting employee salary categories using the Adult Income dataset. 
It includes extensive data cleaning (handling missing values, outlier removal, and encoding categorical variables), followed by model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Gradient Boosting.
The goal is to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic features.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on a test dataset.
